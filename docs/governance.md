title: Project Governance Charter
---

## 1\. Guiding Principles

The xyOps project is built on openness, transparency, and long-term reliability.  This governance model exists to protect those values and ensure that xyOps remains a durable, community-serving open-source project.

-  **Open Access:** All source code and documentation will remain available under the BSD 3-Clause License.
-  **Transparency:** All decisions that materially affect the project will be made publicly and archived for accountability.
-  **Meritocracy:** Influence is earned through high-quality, consistent contributions and alignment with the project's values.
-  **Continuity:** Stewardship decisions prioritize the long-term stability and health of the project above all else.

## 2\. Governance Model

xyOps currently operates under a **Steward-Led** governance model and intends to evolve into a **broader community stewardship model** as the contributor base grows.

### Steward-Led Phase (Current)

PixlCore LLC and Joseph Huckaby serve as the initial maintainers and project stewards.\
Their responsibilities include:

-  Overseeing technical direction and releases
-  Reviewing and merging contributions
-  Ensuring that the project continues to align with the Longevity Pledge and BSD licensing
-  Documenting important decisions in public

### Evolving Toward Shared Stewardship

As xyOps grows, additional trusted contributors may be invited into expanded stewardship roles, including:

-  Maintainers with commit access
-  A small advisory group of experienced contributors who help shape roadmap priorities, review policy changes, and advise on succession matters

This evolution is intentional but not bound to a specific timeline; it will occur naturally as the contributor ecosystem matures.

Decision-making will generally follow **consensus by discussion**.\
If consensus cannot be reached, the Stewards will make a final decision guided by the project's principles and the best interests of long-term stability.

## 3\. Roles & Responsibilities

### Maintainers

-  Have commit access and release authority
-  Review pull requests for technical soundness, security, and consistency
-  Uphold the BSD 3-Clause License for the entire codebase
-  Document notable changes and decisions publicly

### Contributors

-  Provide patches, bug reports, and documentation improvements
-  Agree that all contributions are licensed under the project's existing BSD 3-Clause License
-  May be nominated for expanded roles based on merit, trust, and sustained participation

### Advisory Group (Future)

As the project grows, a small group of trusted contributors may be formalized to:

-  Provide continuity and high-level guidance
-  Review proposals affecting roadmap, policy, or governance
-  Participate in steward succession discussions
-  Help ensure adherence to the Longevity Pledge

This group is advisory rather than executive; final release authority remains with the Stewards unless governance evolves further.

## 4\. Succession & Long-Term Stewardship

To reduce single-maintainer or single-organization risk, xyOps is structured so the project can outlive any individual or entity.

If PixlCore LLC or Joseph Huckaby are ever unable to continue active stewardship:

-  The intention is to transfer stewardship to a suitable successor; ideally a foundation, nonprofit, or trusted maintainer group.
-  Any transfer of stewardship will include clear expectations that xyOps remain openly developed under the BSD 3-Clause License.
-  The community will be notified publicly before any transition is finalized.

This charter does not impose legal obligations but is a public commitment to transparent, community-respecting transitions.

## 5\. Governance Amendments

This document may evolve as xyOps grows. Amendments require:

-  A public pull request
-  Review and approval by current maintainers (and advisory members, once established)
-  No changes that undermine the commitments expressed in the Longevity Pledge or reduce the openness of the project

Amendments will be documented and archived for transparency.

## 6\. Acknowledgment

This charter affirms xyOps' commitment to being not only open source, but responsibly stewarded, transparent in direction, and built for long-term sustainability.
